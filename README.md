# Loan-Application_Predictive-Analysis

## It uses Pandas

## Here, data has been taken as a JSON file

## Following are the questions which I have tried answering Using the Dataset:

    1. Find % of total applicants for each unique value of dependents
    2. Find the average number of dependents per applicant
    3. Find the %of applications approved for self-employed applicants
    4. What is the % of rejections for married male applicants
    5. Which property area has the maximum approval ratio
    6. Find average dependents per income group
    7. Create a simple predictive model to assess whether a loan application will be approved or rejected and provide the accuracy score

## Thankyou! Don't forget to add your remarks here!
